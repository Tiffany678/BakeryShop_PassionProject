Passion Project: Sweet Bakery Shop

The Sweet Bakery shop is a website for selling handmade organic bakery. To make sure the cakes are fresh, the shop only offers a limited number of cakes every day. If you want to have one, you got to order as soon as possible before they are out.

The app is very user-friendly that it is simple and easy to navigate. When the number of any kind of cakes is 5 or lower left, there is a warning sign shown for that kind of cake on the order page. This feature will warn the customers if they want to grab one of these hot sellers.

This app is going to be created using Spring, Java and MySQL with React as the front end.
